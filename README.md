**Problem Statement:**
	How might we use a 3D model of a Museum and sensor data to show its asset maintenance statuses (G/O/R) for building operation staff so that they can prioritise their workload throughout the building and have a way to publicly demonstrate their value.
 



**Solution:**
	The Shadow builder mobile app compatible with android and iOS intends to act as a real time alerting system and help visualize data so that the building managers can make informed decisions.




**Features:**

   - Alerting: Real time alerting system for incidents with the priority and location 
   - Dashboard: Visualisation Tool to understand analytics of the sensor data for Building Manager to take decisions
   - Calendar: Asset maintenance schedules can be viewed on calendar to know and plan the work for smooth functioning of Museum
   - 3D Model: Asset location and their status can be viewed in 3D visualisation for quicker response.



**Steps to install apk**


- Watch the demo video and ppt (Refer Case Study) to understand the functionality of the application.
- Run the iotscript.py to generate the real time alerts.
- Create and install the app-v1.apk in android device.
- Enter the login credential as mentioned in the App Credentials.txt
- For dashboard section use the dashboard crediantials present in the app credentials.txt
